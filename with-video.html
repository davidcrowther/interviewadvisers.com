                        <p>We've built Interview Advisers with one simple goal in mind: we want to help you get a job.</p>
                        <p>When we started, there were a ton of resources out there to help people perfect their resumes and fine-tune their cover letters. It was clear that with the proper amount of time and preparation, most people could get an interview without too much trouble. But when it came time to have a face-to-face conversation with a potential employer, they struggled-and there were very few resources available to help them.</p>
                        <p>So we started <a href="#"><b>Interview Advisers</b></a>, with two employees and a tiny office in New York. Since then we've grown into an incredible community of job seekers, instructors, and industry experts. Now we're one of the most trusted names in interview preparation in the world.</p>
                        <p><b>Here's my promise to you:</b></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-9">
                        <p>We'll provide you with incredibly useful lessons and one-on-one service, all designed to help you ace the interview process. We'll provide a community of past and present clients to guide you, and we'll continue to update and evolve our product to match the quickly-changing employment landscape. And once you get hired, we'll still be there to help you navigate the twists and turns of your professional life.</p>
                        <p>We always leave the light on. Feel free to contact us whenever you have something on your mind.</p>
